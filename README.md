# Random-Quote-Generator
## Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Project 1

This JavaScript program generates a random quote. It does so by using a function named getRandomQuote() to pull a random quote from an array.

The program displays the quote and the person who said it, along with tags and a link to more quotes by the person who said it.

It also looks to see if there is a source and/or year for the quote, and then displays that information if found.
There's also a function for generating a random color, which is used to change the background color every time a quote is loaded.

Users can load another random quote and background color by clicking the button. The program will also automatically refresh every 30 seconds.
